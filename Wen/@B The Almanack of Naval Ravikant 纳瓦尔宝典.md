> Judgment: Wisdom applied to external problems.

> If you can't rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you're lost. You're just memorizing.

### Happiness

> Don't take yourself so seriously. You're just a monkey with a plan.
> 别太把自己当回事，你不过是个会做计划的猴子🐒

> Maybe happiness is not something you inherit or even choose, but a highly personal skill that can be learned, like fitness or nutrition. 

> Today, I believe happiness is really a default state. Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.

> People mistakenly believe happiness is just about positive thoughts and positive actions...every positive thought essentially holds within it a negative thought.

> I've also come to believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self... if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba - or **if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation for how life should "actually" be**. Life is just the way it is.

> Our lives are a blink of a firefly in the night. You're barely here. You have to make the most of every minutes... every second you have on this planet is very precious, and it's your responsibility to make sure you're happy and interpreting everything in the best possible way.

> You can be a long-time meditator, but if someone says the wrong thing in the wrong way, you go back to your ego-driven self.

> A rational person can find peace by cultivating indifference to things outside of their control.

> You can very slowly but steadily and methodically improve your happiness baseline, just like you can improve your fitness.

> Memory and identity are burdens from the past preventing us from living freely in the present.

> Desire is a contract that you made with yourself:
> To be unhappy until you get
> what you want 

[[@P Naval Ravikant]] recognize desire is the source of unhappiness, but didn't advocate total relinquishing of desires, by saying:
> You're meant to do something. You're not just meant to lie there in the sand and meditate all day long. You should self-actualize. You should do what you t to do.

He achieves this by " try not to have more than one big desire life at any given time." and states " It's way more important to perfect your desires than to do something you don't 100% desire"

>Happiness is being satisfied with what you have.
>Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose.

> Survival and replication drive put us on the work treadmill. Hedonic adaptation keeps us there. The trick is knowing when to jump off and play instead.

> [[@P Blaise Pascal 帕斯卡]] says, "All of man's troubles arise because he cannot sit in a room quietly by himself" If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful.

> Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion.

> We think you get peace by resolving all your external problems. But there are unlimited external problems. The only way out is to give up the idea of problems.

> Doing something because you "should" basically means you don't actually want to do it. It's just making you miserable, so I'm trying to eliminate as many "shoulds" from my life as possible.

> **Massive Multiplayer Competitive Game, 
> 
> we don't know how to play single-player games. But the reality is life is a single-player game.

> All the real scorecards are internal.

> Essentially, you have to go through your life replacing your thoughtless bad habits with good ones, making a commitment to be a happier person.

> Happiness is a skill. You decide it's important to you. You prioritize it above everything else. You read everything on the topic.

> **Every time you catch yourself desiring something, say, "is it so important to me I'll be unhappy unless this goes my way?"

> Caught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for the rest of day.

> **A personal metric: how much of the day is spend doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest?

> **In any situation, you always have three choices: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it. 
> If you want to change it, then it is a desire. It will cause you suffering until you successfully change it. So don't pick too many of those. Pick one big desire in your life at any given time to give yourself purpose and motivation. **

### 幸福

> 不要把自己看得那么严重。你只是一只有计划的猴子。
> 别太把自己当回事，你不过是个会做计划的猴子🐒。

> 也许幸福不是你继承的东西，甚至不是你选择的东西，而是一种可以学习的高度个人化的技能，就像健身或营养。

> 今天，我相信幸福真的是一种默认状态。当你消除了生活中缺少的东西的感觉时，幸福就在那里。

> 人们错误地认为幸福只是关于积极的想法和积极的行动......每个积极的想法基本上都包含着消极的想法。

> 我也开始相信自我的完全和彻底的无足轻重......如果你把自己看作是一个细菌或变形虫--或者**如果你把你所有的作品看作是在水上写字或在沙地上建城堡，那么你对生活应该如何 "实际 "是没有期望的**。生活就是它的样子。

> 我们的生活是黑夜中一闪而过的萤火虫。你几乎不在这里。你必须充分利用每一分钟......你在这个星球上的每一秒钟都非常宝贵，你有责任确保你快乐并以最好的方式解释一切。

> 你可以是一个长期的冥想者，但如果有人以错误的方式说了错误的话，你就会回到自我驱动的自我。

> 一个理性的人可以通过培养对自己控制之外的事物的冷漠来找到平静。

> 你可以非常缓慢但稳定地、有条不紊地提高你的幸福底线，就像你可以提高你的体能一样。

> 记忆和身份是来自过去的负担，阻止我们自由地生活在现在。

> 欲望是你与自己签订的合同。
> 不快乐，直到你得到
> 你想要的东西 

[[@P Naval Ravikant]]承认欲望是不快乐的来源，但并不主张完全放弃欲望，他说。
> 你注定要做一些事情。你不应该只是躺在沙子里，整天冥想。你应该自我实现。你应该做你想做的事。

他通过 "尽量不要在任何时候有超过一个大的欲望生活 "来实现这一点，并指出 "完善你的欲望比做你不是100%渴望的事情更重要。"

>幸福是对你所拥有的东西感到满意。
>成功来自于不满意。选择。

>生存和复制的动力把我们放在工作的跑步机上。享乐主义的适应使我们留在那里。诀窍是知道什么时候该跳下去玩。

> [[@P布莱斯-帕斯卡]]说，"人的所有烦恼都是因为他不能一个人安静地坐在房间里。

> 和平是休息时的幸福，而幸福是运动中的和平。

> 我们认为你通过解决你所有的外部问题来获得和平。但外部问题是无限的。唯一的出路是放弃问题的想法。

> 因为你 "应该 "而做某件事，基本上意味着你实际上并不想做这件事。它只是让你感到痛苦，所以我正试图从我的生活中尽可能多地消除 "应该"。

> **大型多人竞技游戏。
> 
> 我们不知道如何玩单人游戏。但现实是生活是一个单人游戏。

> 所有真正的记分卡都是内部的。

> 本质上，你必须通过你的生活，用好的习惯取代你不经意的坏习惯，承诺成为一个更快乐的人。

> 幸福是一种技能。你决定它对你很重要。你把它置于其他一切之上。你阅读所有关于这个主题的文章。

> **每当你发现自己渴望得到什么时，就说："这对我来说如此重要，如果不按我的方式进行，我就会不快乐吗？"

> 陷入低潮？使用冥想、音乐和运动来重设你的情绪。然后选择一条新的道路，在一天的剩余时间里投入情感能量。

> **个人的衡量标准：一天中有多少时间是出于义务而不是出于兴趣来做事的？

> **在任何情况下，你总是有三个选择：你可以改变它，你可以接受它，或者你可以离开它。
> 如果你想改变它，那么它就是一个欲望。它将给你带来痛苦，直到你成功改变它。所以不要挑选太多这样的东西。在任何时候，在你的生活中挑选一个大的愿望，给自己一个目标和动力。**

### Saving yourslef
> Your goal in life is to find the people, business, project, or art that needs you the most. 

Walking meeting

[[@P Jerzy Gregorek]] "Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life."

> An emotion is our evolved biology predicting the future impact of a current event. In modern settings, it's usually exaggerated or wrong.

> Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. 
> Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.

> **Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.

> Insight meditation lets you run your brain in debug mode until you realize you're just a subroutine in a larger program.

> **I have to look at my brain again and say. "Do I really need to solve this problem right now?"

> The mind itself is a muscle - it can be trained and conditioned. It has been haphazardly conditioned by society to be out of our control.
> 

> The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.

> It helps to start our by saying: " I'm never going to be popular. I'm never going to be accepted. I'm already a loser... I've just got to be happy being me"

> **For self-improvement without self-discipline, update your self-image.

> Grind and sweat, toil and bleed, face the abyss. It's all part of becoming an overnight success.

> The hardest thing is not doing what you want - it's knowing what you want.

> Be aware there are no "adults. Everyone makes it up as they go along.

From "Freedom to " -> "Freedom from"

> Courage isn't charging into a machine gun nest. Courage is not caring what other people think.

> **A taste of freedom can make you unemployable.

> just being aware you're a rat in a race is about as far as most of us are going to get.

###拯救你自己
> 你的人生目标是找到最需要你的人、生意、项目或艺术。

徒步会议

[[@P Jerzy Gregorek]] "轻松的选择，艰难的生活。艰难的选择，轻松的生活"。

> 情绪是我们进化的生物学预测当前事件的未来影响。在现代环境中，它通常被夸大或错误。

> 冥想是对心灵的间歇性禁食。
> 在自我检查、写日记、冥想中不受干扰地独自度过的时间，可以解决未解决的问题，使我们从精神上的肥胖变成健康。

> **生活小窍门。躺在床上时，进行冥想。要么你会有一个深刻的冥想，要么睡着了。无论哪种方式都是胜利。

> 洞察力冥想让你在调试模式下运行你的大脑，直到你意识到你只是一个大程序中的子程序。

> **我必须再次审视我的大脑，然后说。"我真的需要现在就解决这个问题吗？"

> 心灵本身就是一块肌肉--它可以被训练和调节。它已经被社会胡乱地调教成不受我们控制。
> 

> 最大的超级力量是改变自己的能力。

> 当我34岁的时候，我会给24岁的自己什么建议？
> 现在是2032年，我在做什么？我当时的感觉如何？

从非常长远的角度出发，把情感的东西拿出来

> 在任何时候，我不是在努力捡起一个好习惯，就是在丢弃以前的坏习惯。

> 内部革命的状态。你应该始终在内心做好彻底改变的准备。

> **对行动不耐烦，对结果不耐烦。

> [[@P Nivi]] 灵感是易逝的。当你有灵感的时候，就马上采取行动。

> 如果有什么事情你想以后做，现在就做。没有什么 "以后"。

> 在开始时说一句话会有帮助。"我永远不会成为受欢迎的人。我永远不会被接受。我已经是个失败者了...... 我只是要快乐地做我自己"

> **对于没有自律的自我改善，更新你的自我形象。

> 磨练和流汗，辛劳和流血，面对深渊。这都是一夜成名的一部分。

> 最困难的事情不是做你想做的事--而是知道你想要什么。

> 要知道没有 "成年人"。每个人都是边走边做的。

从 "自由"->"自由"。
