### [[@A The Logic of Effective Altruism]]
[The Logic of Effective Altruism - Boston Review](https://bostonreview.net/forum/peter-singer-logic-effective-altruism/)

Effective altruism is notable for 
	strive to make a difference to the world
	a way of giving meaning to our own lives and finding fulfillment in what we do

DEF: a philosophy and social movement which applies evidence and reason to determining the most effective ways to improve the world

Altruism is contrasted with egoism, which is concern only for oneself. But we should not think of effective altruism as requiring self-sacrifice, in the sense of something necessarily contrary to one’s own interests.

> A quick run through the history books shows that smart people trying to effect systemic change have an imperfect track record. I won’t say that they’re unusually_bad compared to other demographics, but certainly nothing as stellar as the “let’s just not be morons” theory might lead one to expect.

>There are many more ways to break systems than to improve them...Given an awareness of long-tail risks and the difficulty of navigating these waters, I’m not sure our expected value for systemic change activism should even be positive, let alone the most good we can do.

>There’s another problem with man vs. man: the people we want to recruit are men, and the people we want to make our movement out of are men.
