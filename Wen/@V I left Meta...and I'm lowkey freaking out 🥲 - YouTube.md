> **vision board** on my 26th birthday here's the vision that i had for myself. I am fully remote and have multiple streams of income mostly online that is at least 50 passive which allows me to spontaneously travel to different places and focus on what I find the most impactful work without worrying about making ends meet I also have a fully staffed team that I trust to keep the business running and I focus on learning and creating content work towards my goal of financial freedom, time freedom, location freedom, and all of that leading to the intellectual freedom which is doing what I find the most meaningful at any time without worrying about making ends meet
